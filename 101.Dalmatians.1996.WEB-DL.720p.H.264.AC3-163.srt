00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,406
We're all familiar
with the illegal poaching...

2
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,539
Of endangered animals
in the wild...

3
00:02:45,617 --> 00:02:50,314
But never before has an animal in
captivity been slaughtered for its pelt.

4
00:02:50,388 --> 00:02:53,879
Animal protection groups
that monitor the international trade...

5
00:02:53,958 --> 00:02:56,357
In game contraband
have further told us...

6
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:59,088
That a white Siberian tiger
is so rare that the offer...

7
00:02:59,162 --> 00:03:01,392
- Of a pelt would surely draw the
attention... -

8
00:03:01,466 --> 00:03:03,797
Of law enforcement agencies.

9
00:03:03,869 --> 00:03:05,858
Shortly before dawn this morning...

10
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:09,735
Security staff at London Zoo
discovered the excoriated carcass...

11
00:03:09,807 --> 00:03:14,437
Of its prized three-year-old
female Siberian tiger, Sue Ling.

12
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:16,240
Police sources have suggested...

13
00:03:16,314 --> 00:03:19,407
That the killing was contracted
by a private collector.

14
00:03:19,484 --> 00:03:22,543
Oh, isn't that horrible?
Who'd do a thing like that?

15
00:03:22,654 --> 00:03:24,154
If the battle to preserve
endangered species

16
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:25,678
has moved into the urban
zoological park...

17
00:03:25,757 --> 00:03:29,020
We must ask ourselves if
any animal in the world is safe.

18
00:03:29,093 --> 00:03:33,654
- - This is Tim
Ryan, reporting from London Zoo.

19
00:04:10,468 --> 00:04:13,698
Another bad day
for the animal kingdom.

20
00:04:15,406 --> 00:04:17,840
Oh, one day...

21
00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:21,468
Very soon, Pongo,
I'm going to make a sale.

22
00:04:21,546 --> 00:04:23,513
We're fast approaching
the point where I'm

23
00:04:23,526 --> 00:04:25,504
gonna have to start
eating your table scraps.

24
00:04:27,584 --> 00:04:29,643
Oh.

25
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:32,484
I was exaggerating.
Well, shall we?

26
00:04:32,557 --> 00:04:35,047
It's not that bad.

27
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,423
It's very important
this meeting goes well.

28
00:04:37,494 --> 00:04:39,428
You know how I am about meetings.

29
00:04:39,496 --> 00:04:41,430
I tend to get a little, well, nervous.

30
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:44,578
When I get nervous, I say things, I do
things I shouldn't say, I shouldn't do.

31
00:04:44,636 --> 00:04:48,662
And the next thing we know, freelancing.

32
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:55,741
He's got the best instincts
in the industry.

33
00:04:55,813 --> 00:04:59,771
Since he was six, he's picked
the top-selling game every year.

34
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:18,533
Well?

35
00:05:18,603 --> 00:05:21,229
What do you think?

36
00:05:21,305 --> 00:05:24,638
Potentially good graphics,
reasonably entertaining premise...

37
00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:27,836
The dog's well-conceived
and the environments are engaging.

38
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:30,379
But I'm not interested
in a game that has...

39
00:05:30,448 --> 00:05:33,177
A chubby little dogcatcher
as the bad guy.

40
00:05:33,251 --> 00:05:35,980
Even girls won't like this game.

41
00:05:36,054 --> 00:05:39,511
- Sorry, mate. - Yeah, but wait,
wait, wait. Herbert, wait!

42
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,629
What if there were a better villain?
You know, someone you could really hate?

43
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:48,030
It's not hatred that's important.
It's a desire to annihilate.

44
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:16,583
Top of the morning
to ya, Ma'am.

45
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,909
Morning, Ma'am.

46
00:06:35,202 --> 00:06:37,322
Morning, Miss De Vil's office.
Could you hold, please?

47
00:06:37,347 --> 00:06:39,781
Yes, I'll be with you in a moment.
Could you hold, please?

48
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:42,511
Thank you. Good morning,
Miss De Vil's office. Could you hold?

49
00:06:42,587 --> 00:06:44,019
Good morning, Miss De Vil.

50
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:49,355
- Morning, Miss De Vil.
- Morning.

51
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:57,299
Morning, Ma'am.

52
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,975
Anita, darling.

53
00:07:10,048 --> 00:07:11,980
Good morning, Cruella.

54
00:07:25,996 --> 00:07:28,623
- What a charming dog.
- Thank you.

55
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:31,690
- Spots?
- Yes, she's dalmatian.

56
00:07:31,769 --> 00:07:34,236
- Inspiration?
- Yes.

57
00:07:34,305 --> 00:07:36,397
- Long hair or short?
- Short.

58
00:07:36,474 --> 00:07:40,341
- Coarse or fine?
- I'm afraid it is a little coarse.

59
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,072
- Pity! - But it was very
fine when she was a puppy.

60
00:07:43,148 --> 00:07:46,741
Redemption! We need to have
a little girl talk.

61
00:07:46,818 --> 00:07:48,875
Come to my office.

62
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:51,216
Bring the drawing.

63
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:54,052
Now, darling, tell me
more about these spots.

64
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,057
I did leopard spots
in the '80s.

65
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:58,560
Well, dalmatian spots are
a little different, aren't they?

66
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,358
- Cozy. Classic.
- Cuddly. Less trashy.

67
00:08:01,432 --> 00:08:04,628
Exactly!
Do you like spots, Frederick?

68
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:08,193
Oh, I don't believe so, Madame.
I thought we liked stripes this year.

69
00:08:08,272 --> 00:08:10,501
What kind of sycophant are you?

70
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:14,567
Um, what kind of sycophant
would you like me to be'?

71
00:08:14,646 --> 00:08:17,340
Frederick...

72
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:21,111
I'm beginning to see spots.

73
00:08:21,186 --> 00:08:24,881
- What would it cost us to start again
on next year's line? - Millions.

74
00:08:24,956 --> 00:08:27,355
- Can we afford it?
- Well, yes...

75
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:31,553
Pay it, darling. Now go away.
I have to talk to Anita.

76
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:33,823
Alonzo?

77
00:08:33,898 --> 00:08:36,798
Did you ask Anita if
she'd like something to drink?

78
00:08:38,569 --> 00:08:41,901
Oh, l-l... I'm fine, thank you.

79
00:08:45,609 --> 00:08:47,542
Sit down, please.

80
00:08:51,081 --> 00:08:53,674
How long have you been
working for me'?

81
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:56,014
Two years last August.

82
00:08:56,087 --> 00:09:00,147
- And you've done wonderful
work in that time. - Thank you.

83
00:09:00,225 --> 00:09:03,056
- I don't see you socially, do I?
- No.

84
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:07,062
And you're not very well-known,
despite your obvious talent.

85
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:10,031
Well, notoriety doesn't
mean very much to me.

86
00:09:10,101 --> 00:09:14,263
Your work is fresh and clean,
unfettered, unpretentious.

87
00:09:14,338 --> 00:09:16,396
It sells.
And one of these days...

88
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:19,032
My competitors are going
to suss out who you are...

89
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,236
And they're going
to try to steal you away.

90
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:23,540
Oh, no. If I left,
it wouldn't be for another job.

91
00:09:23,614 --> 00:09:26,707
Oh, really?
What would it be for?

92
00:09:26,784 --> 00:09:29,342
Well, I don't know.

93
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,253
Urn, if I met someone, if working here
didn't fit in with our plans.

94
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,292
- Marriage.
- Perhaps.

95
00:09:36,361 --> 00:09:38,623
More good women have been
lost to marriage...

96
00:09:38,696 --> 00:09:41,960
Than to war, famine,
disease and disaster.

97
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:45,296
You have talent, darling.
Don't squander it.

98
00:09:45,369 --> 00:09:48,770
Well, I don't think that it's something
we have to worry about.

99
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,331
- I don't have any prospects.
- Thank God.

100
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,638
Well, I should be
getting back to work.

101
00:09:54,712 --> 00:09:58,078
Yes, please do.
Alonzo.

102
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:03,848
The drawing.

103
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,083
Take the drawing from Anita
and hand it to me!

104
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,684
Is that difficult?

105
00:10:15,832 --> 00:10:17,697
Thank you.

106
00:10:17,768 --> 00:10:20,702
Now go. Stand somewhere 'til I need you.

107
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,338
I look wonderful in spots.

108
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:30,846
However, I would like
to make one small change.

109
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:36,614
We could do this in linen.

110
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:38,779
It would be stunning in fur.

111
00:10:38,854 --> 00:10:40,846
But you'll be wearing it
to the Chesterton Trials.

112
00:10:40,924 --> 00:10:43,187
That's in April.
Fur would be inappropriate.

113
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,591
But it's my only true love, darling.

114
00:10:45,663 --> 00:10:48,494
I live for fur. I worship fur.

115
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:52,262
After all, is there a woman
in all this wretched world who doesn't?

116
00:10:52,337 --> 00:10:54,929
Give it to Anita.

117
00:10:56,506 --> 00:10:58,872
<i>Oh.</i>

118
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,873
It is rather amusing, isn't it?

119
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,712
What is?

120
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:10,480
Well, if we make this coat...

121
00:11:10,555 --> 00:11:13,044
It would be as if
I were wearing your dog.

122
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:18,353
Woof! Woof!

be able to get a car. -

00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:53,641
Pongo!

159
00:14:57,047 --> 00:14:59,481
Go fetch the ball.

160
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:01,346
Goon

161
00:15:18,435 --> 00:15:20,402
Hello.
Who are you?

162
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,122
Aaah!

163
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:43,181
<i>L</i> got you.

164
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:45,727
Very smart.
Very funny.

165
00:15:45,796 --> 00:15:49,230
- Everybody had a good laugh.
- Let go of that dog!

166
00:15:49,299 --> 00:15:53,166
- Stay outta this, lady.
- Stop it, or I'll... I'll hit you!

167
00:15:53,237 --> 00:15:55,363
Today is not a good day
to threaten me, Ma'am.

168
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:58,430
I don't care if it's a good day
or a bad day, I'll hit you nonetheless!

169
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:01,101
- Whatever. - Okay, I gave you
a good and proper warning.

170
00:16:01,178 --> 00:16:03,145
Look, I've had...

171
00:16:03,214 --> 00:16:05,840
Now, release my dog...

172
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:08,850
Or I'll hit you again!

173
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:10,886
Your dog?

174
00:16:10,955 --> 00:16:13,422
Yes, that is my dog.
Will you let her go?

175
00:16:15,493 --> 00:16:18,153
Excuse me.

176
00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:24,966

178
00:16:30,841 --> 00:16:34,901
Hello, Pongo.

179
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,738
I, beg your pardon, Ma'am.

180
00:16:38,816 --> 00:16:40,782
I'm sorry. My mistake.

181
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:44,411
- What do you got in that purse
of yours? Rocks? - Oh, no.

182
00:16:44,487 --> 00:16:47,547
Bricks. I've been
paving my garden...

183
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,456
And every time I see a discarded brick,
I just pick it up.

184
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:53,461
- How many did you find today?
- Three.

185
00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:56,055
- Three? Oh, well, that's what
I would've guessed. -

186
00:16:56,132 --> 00:17:00,534
- Why are you all wet?
- I went swimming in the pond.

187
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:02,969
- Oh, you shouldn't have. The
water's filthy. -

188
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,029
Yes, and it tastes like fish.

189
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:07,974
And, urn, you've lost a shoe.
Did you know that?

190
00:17:08,045 --> 00:17:09,977
Yes, I did.
As a matter of fact, I did.

191
00:17:10,045 --> 00:17:12,776
- I noticed it running down the gravelled
path. - Oh, I'm ever so sorry.

192
00:17:12,848 --> 00:17:14,554
I mean, you know, I
thought if you were silly

193
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,284
enough to go swimming
in a dirty pond...

194
00:17:16,353 --> 00:17:19,344
You'd be silly enough
not to realize you'd lost a shoe.

195
00:17:19,423 --> 00:17:21,754
Actually, I crashed
my bicycle in the pond.

196
00:17:21,826 --> 00:17:25,260
And the only part of my body
that wasn't injured was my head.

197
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:28,319
But now, thanks to you, I got
the complete set of bodily injuries.

198
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:34,128
- Well, it was nice being assaulted
by you, Ms.... - Oh, my name's Anita.

199
00:17:34,204 --> 00:17:36,137
- Anita?
- And yours is Roger.

200
00:17:36,207 --> 00:17:40,141
- Urn, I read it on your dog's
identification tag. - Oh. Oh, yes.

201
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:43,736
Well, nice meeting you.
I hope I didn't alarm you.

202
00:17:43,814 --> 00:17:45,803
Oh, no, that's fine since...

203
00:17:45,883 --> 00:17:49,078
Well, we both seem to have
a certain fondness for dalmatians.

204
00:17:49,153 --> 00:17:51,347
Yes.

205

<i>_</i>

206
00:17:54,425 --> 00:17:56,414
Well, they certainly have...

207
00:17:56,494 --> 00:18:00,326
- A certain fondness for each
other, don't they? - Yeah.

208
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,863
Well, Pongo...

209
00:18:07,938 --> 00:18:10,872
Your roving eye's gotten me
in enough trouble for one day.

210
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:14,375
Why don't you come with me
and we'll go home?

211
00:18:14,444 --> 00:18:17,572
Urn, are you sure you'll be all right?
Perhaps you should call your doctor.

212
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:19,910
I'll be fine, fine. Just...
Good luck with your bricks.

213
00:18:19,983 --> 00:18:23,418
If you have a concussion,
you shouldn't be left alone, you know.

214
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:27,149
- Pongo, you could've gotten me killed,
you know that? -

215
00:18:27,224 --> 00:18:30,590
You risk losing your master
for a brief frolic with a female?

216
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:37,698
Come on.

217
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:43,103
Jolly nice human, don't you think?

218
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:49,141
Fools aren't born, Pongo. Pretty girls
make them in their spare time.

219
00:18:56,986 --> 00:19:00,387
Shall we?
Come on.

220
00:19:00,457 --> 00:19:03,948
Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Thank you.

It has nothing whatsoever to do with

Oh, I've never
been rescued before.

00:20:22,506 --> 00:20:26,407
It was very exciting. You were
ever so sweet to give me a kiss.

240
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:29,672
That wasn't a kiss.
That was mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

00:20:29,747 --> 00:20:32,407
- Oh.
- Besides, it... it didn't work very well.

242
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,813
You're supposed to lie
flat on your back and remain still.

243
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:38,285
I couldn't really do it properly
with your arms around my neck.

244
00:20:38,355 --> 00:20:41,812
- I'm ever so sorry.
- No, no, no, that's quite all right.

00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:45,520
Well, you give
a very good rescue.

<i>Oh.</i>

I think my dog is in love.

250
00:21:07,651 --> 00:21:11,381
I think mine is, too.

251
00:21:11,455 --> 00:21:14,115
Why is that a problem?

252
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:16,783
They're going to be brokenhearted
when you leave.

253
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:22,020
Oh, I don't think I could bear to live
with a brokenhearted dalmatian.

254
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:25,123
Yes, they're miserable
when they're lonely.

255
00:21:25,202 --> 00:21:28,500
- Well, we'd better think of something.
- I agree.

256
00:21:29,806 --> 00:21:32,171
- Do you want another cup of marriage?
- Excuse me'?

257
00:21:32,242 --> 00:21:34,539
Tea?
Another cup of tea?

258
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:37,340
- You said "marriage."
- Marriage?

259
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:39,972
Yes, that's what you said.
I... I mean, you meant to say "tea"...

260
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:42,039
But it...
it came out "marriage."

261
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:44,245
Oh, I'm sorry.

262
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,813
Do you want another cup of tea?

263
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,584
I do.

264
00:21:54,931 --> 00:21:57,296
You... You do?

265
00:21:58,334 --> 00:22:00,267
I will.

266
00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:02,167
You will?

267
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:05,665
If you ask me.

268
00:22:08,611 --> 00:22:11,102
Would you?

269
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,114
Yes.

270
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:31,793
For as much
as Roger and Anita...

271
00:22:33,236 --> 00:22:37,103
Have consented together
in holy wedlock...

272
00:22:37,174 --> 00:22:41,040
And have witnessed the same
before God and this company...

273
00:22:41,111 --> 00:22:45,672
And thereto have given and pledged
their troth either to other...

274
00:22:45,749 --> 00:22:47,681
And declared the same...

275
00:22:47,751 --> 00:22:50,651
By the giving
and receiving of a ring...

276
00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:53,051
And by joining of hands...

277
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:56,683
I pronounce that they be
man and wife together.

278
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,692
In the name of the Father...

279
00:22:58,762 --> 00:23:01,491
And of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost.

280
00:23:01,565 --> 00:23:03,725
- Amen.
- Amen.

281
00:23:03,801 --> 00:23:06,427
God the Father, God the Son...

282
00:23:06,503 --> 00:23:08,800
God the Holy Ghost...

283
00:23:08,871 --> 00:23:11,931
Bless, preserve and keep you.

284
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:15,409
The Lord, mercifully with
his favor, look upon you...

285
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:19,175
And so fill you with all
spiritual benediction and grace...

286
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:23,385
That ye may so live
together in this life...

287
00:23:23,454 --> 00:23:25,443
And in the world to come.

288
00:23:25,521 --> 00:23:28,649
And may you have
life everlasting.

289
00:23:28,725 --> 00:23:31,318
- Amen.
- Amen.

290
00:24:30,186 --> 00:24:34,417
Right. Now let me tell you a bit about
this bloke Skinner before we meet him.

291
00:24:34,491 --> 00:24:37,925
Now supposedly,
when he was quite young...

292
00:24:37,994 --> 00:24:40,086
This dog tore open
his throat...

293
00:24:40,163 --> 00:24:42,323
And ripped out
his vocal cords...

294
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:44,832
Leaving him brutally scarred
and completely mute.

295
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:47,699
He cannot talk at all.

296
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,534
Now pay atten-
Look at me. Pay attention.

297
00:24:50,607 --> 00:24:54,667
This is very important. There are
two things you must not do with Skinner.

298
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:56,677
Right? One:

299
00:24:56,747 --> 00:25:00,374
Do not look at
the horrendous scar on his neck.

300
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,542
Two:
Don't talk to him.

301
00:25:02,619 --> 00:25:07,180
- Understand? Not a word.
- Right.

302
00:25:10,694 --> 00:25:12,626
Aaah!

303
00:25:12,696 --> 00:25:15,789
Look at the size of that scar!

304
00:25:15,866 --> 00:25:18,526
No bloody wonder
you can't talk, mate!

305
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:24,201
Excuse me just a minute, would you'?

306
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:39,145
Gol. Bloody gruesome line
of work you're in, Skinner.

307
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:44,723
The sight of all these deceased
creatures gives me a shrinky winky.

308
00:25:58,174 --> 00:26:01,108
Much obliged, sunshine.

309
00:26:16,626 --> 00:26:19,253
How could she do this to me?

310
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:34,339
- Morning, Ma'am.
- Sit!

311
00:26:35,778 --> 00:26:38,542
- Tea?
- Please.

312
00:26:38,615 --> 00:26:41,139
Please.

313
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,987
Thank you.

314
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,992
Thank you.

315
00:26:53,062 --> 00:26:55,655
Ooh, oh, what
a beautiful day, Ma'am.

316
00:26:55,732 --> 00:26:57,994
Blue skies, birds singing...

317
00:26:58,067 --> 00:27:00,626
The laughter of school children
riding on the gentle breeze...

318
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:03,330
Get on with it, you imbecile!

319
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:08,309
Well, I...

320
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:11,369
I have here a present
from Mr. Skinner.

321
00:27:23,026 --> 00:27:24,993
<i>Oh.</i>

322
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:27,392
Oh, it's magnificent.

323
00:27:27,464 --> 00:27:29,931
Hello, my beauty.

324
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,764
Oh, come, come.
Come with me.

325
00:27:33,837 --> 00:27:37,396
Come with me, <i>my</i> darling.
Let me see you.

326
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:41,198
Oh!

327
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,235
You were a big, bad boy,
weren't you, darling?

328
00:27:45,315 --> 00:27:47,247
Yes, yes, yes.

329
00:27:47,317 --> 00:27:50,251
Siberian tiger suits Madame
very well, indeed.

330
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:52,844
Mirror, mirror on the wall...

331
00:27:52,923 --> 00:27:55,617
Who's the fairest of them all?

332
00:27:55,692 --> 00:27:57,624
You are.

333
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,691
I remember you were
always very good at drawing...

334
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,964
When you were a little girl.

335
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,836
And now to be with you again
as you start a family of your own...

336
00:28:11,907 --> 00:28:13,898
Is like a dream come true.

337
00:28:13,976 --> 00:28:16,706
Oh, Nanny.

338
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,577
I don't think Roger and I are
quite ready to start a family yet.

339
00:28:19,648 --> 00:28:24,085
Oh, that's a shame.
Aw, well, first the puppies.

340
00:28:25,521 --> 00:28:27,989
Then the babies.

341
00:28:28,058 --> 00:28:29,990
Puppies?

342
00:28:38,701 --> 00:28:41,135
If I've done
my job right, Pongo...

343
00:28:41,203 --> 00:28:45,162
When this new villain comes up, you're
gonna run from the room in a panic.

344
00:28:58,888 --> 00:29:01,185
JJ"

345
00:29:01,258 --> 00:29:05,283
J "J"

346
00:29:05,361 --> 00:29:07,260
G" Ya!
A"sh!

347
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,858
- <i>_</i>

348
00:29:12,934 --> 00:29:13,002
It's unmistakable, dear.

349
00:29:13,003 --> 00:29:15,401
It's unmistakable, dear.

350
00:29:15,471 --> 00:29:19,805
It's the look every woman gets when she
knows she's going to be a mother.

351
00:29:19,876 --> 00:29:23,037
Notice how tranquil she is.

352
00:29:23,113 --> 00:29:27,275
Her eyes are soft and warm.

353
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:29,840
Though you might not see it...

354
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,082
You can certainly feel
that she's smiling.

355
00:29:34,157 --> 00:29:36,590
It's the smile we wear...

356
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,093
When we're guarding
a precious secret.

357
00:29:39,161 --> 00:29:42,824
And now that she's living
for others as well as herself...

358
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:45,764
She's eating more.

359
00:29:45,835 --> 00:29:48,200
And every now and again...

360
00:29:48,271 --> 00:29:53,173
For no reason other than she's so happy
with herself, she sighs.

361
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:59,677
I think you're right, Nanny.

362
00:29:59,749 --> 00:30:01,943
I think she does
look different.

363
00:30:02,018 --> 00:30:06,476
- Oh, my goodness.
- What is it, Nanny?

364
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:12,019
Anita...

365
00:30:12,095 --> 00:30:14,858
I think you're going
to have a puppy.

366
00:30:14,931 --> 00:30:16,864
Oh!

367
00:30:31,514 --> 00:30:33,504
Thank you so much.

368
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:36,278
- A month's time for a checkup, please?
- All right.

369
00:30:36,353 --> 00:30:38,512
See you again soon, all right?

370
00:30:44,293 --> 00:30:45,953
So?

371
00:30:46,029 --> 00:30:49,327
Well, he said it's all great,
urn, the baby's nice and big...

372
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:51,593
- It's the right size.
- That's wonderful!

373
00:31:00,175 --> 00:31:03,076
- Oh, no.
- What?

374
00:31:13,155 --> 00:31:14,713
Cruella!

375
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:17,019
Anita, darling!

376
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:22,491
Oh, Anita.

377
00:31:22,566 --> 00:31:24,896
Those dazzling dogs!

378
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,402
And you must be Rufus.

379
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:31,371
No, it's... it's Roger.
And it's a pleasure, Miss De Vil.

380
00:31:31,441 --> 00:31:34,340
- What's a pleasure?
- Making your acquaintance.

381
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:38,004
Such a sweet thought.
I wish I could reciprocate.

382
00:31:38,081 --> 00:31:41,344
Tell me, darling,
you married him for his dog.

383
00:31:43,886 --> 00:31:46,877
Oh, darling,
I've missed you so.

384
00:31:46,956 --> 00:31:48,946
I hate that you've taken leave.

385
00:31:49,024 --> 00:31:51,822
But I'm still working.
Urn, you've been getting my sketches?

386
00:31:51,895 --> 00:31:54,828
Well, it's not the same thing.
I miss the interaction...

387
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:01,799
And what is it that you do...

388
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:05,897
That allows you to support Anita
in such... splendor?

389
00:32:05,975 --> 00:32:10,035
- I design video games.
- Video games?

390
00:32:10,113 --> 00:32:12,478
Is he having me on'?

391
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:16,142
Oh, no, he's very good at it.
Urn, and it's a growing business.

392
00:32:16,217 --> 00:32:18,652
Those horrible noisy things that
children play with on their televisions?

393
00:32:18,722 --> 00:32:22,656
Someone designs them? What a senseless
thing to do with your life.

394
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,658
Oh, did Anita
tell you the news?

395
00:32:28,797 --> 00:32:30,992
She's going to have a baby.

396
00:32:32,735 --> 00:32:34,725
Is this true?

397
00:32:34,803 --> 00:32:36,998
Yes.

398
00:32:37,073 --> 00:32:40,041
Oh, you poor thing!
I'm so sorry.

399
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,406
We're very excited
about it, Cruella.

400
00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:44,912
- You can't be serious.
- She is!

401
00:32:46,115 --> 00:32:49,880
Well, what can I say?
Accidents will happen.

402
00:32:49,953 --> 00:32:53,478
- We're having puppies, too!
- Puppies!

403
00:32:53,556 --> 00:32:56,581
You have been a busy boy.

404
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:01,186
Well, I must say, that's somewhat
better news. I adore puppies!

405
00:33:01,264 --> 00:33:05,631
- I'll expect a decline in your work
product. - Oh, I shouldn't think so.

406
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:08,863
Be sure to let me know
when the blessed event occurs.

407
00:33:08,937 --> 00:33:11,201
Oh, well, it won't be
for another eight months.

408
00:33:11,274 --> 00:33:14,333
The puppies, darling.

409
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:16,878
Ooh.

410
00:33:18,047 --> 00:33:21,607
I've no use for babies.

411
00:33:23,385 --> 00:33:25,353
Cheerio!
Cheerio, darling!

412
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:44,864
If I'm this nervous
about your puppies...

413
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:46,964
What am I gonna be like
when my baby arrives?

414
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,054
How can you be so calm?

415
00:34:04,226 --> 00:34:06,159
Nanny!

416
00:34:08,665 --> 00:34:12,190
Oh, my goodness!
Oh! Oh!

417
00:34:12,268 --> 00:34:14,496
Gangway!

418
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:17,231
Is it time?
Ls there something I can do?

419
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:19,330
Maybe... Maybe I can be
of some help!

420
00:34:28,584 --> 00:34:31,313
All right, get out,
peek in through the window...

421
00:34:31,387 --> 00:34:34,480
And see if those puppies
have come yet.

422
00:34:34,557 --> 00:34:36,524
Can I borrow your umbrella?

423
00:34:41,797 --> 00:34:44,595
Be careful when you open it.

424
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:47,965
They're here!
The puppies are here!

425
00:34:48,037 --> 00:34:51,005
You're a father, Pongo!

426
00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:53,837
_  Tw u _ Two! o.

427
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,172
You're a father twice!

428
00:34:56,245 --> 00:34:58,804
Make that three!

429
00:34:58,882 --> 00:35:01,007
Three! Three, Pongo!

430
00:35:03,086 --> 00:35:06,315
- Oh, my goodness! Four!
- Four!

431
00:35:30,646 --> 00:35:34,104
Fifteen.

432
00:35:37,085 --> 00:35:40,384
Did you hear that, boy?
Fifteen puppies!

433
00:35:43,425 --> 00:35:46,087
Fourteen.

434
00:35:46,161 --> 00:35:49,596
We lost one.

435
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:29,401
I'm sorry, Pongo.
I'm so sorry.

436
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:44,541
I wonder.

437
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,692
<i>_</i>

438
00:37:31,968 --> 00:37:36,096
Fifteen!
We have 15 puppies!

439
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,605
Look. Oh!

440
00:37:40,676 --> 00:37:44,634
Goodness gracious!
It's a miracle!

441
00:37:44,714 --> 00:37:47,204
Anita, 15!

442
00:37:47,282 --> 00:37:49,750
Fifteen again!
Oh!

443
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:52,218
We must call
this one "Lucky."

444
00:37:54,289 --> 00:37:56,723
Look!
Look at him.

445
00:37:56,793 --> 00:37:58,725
Oh.

446
00:37:58,795 --> 00:38:00,728
- How's Perdy?
- She's tired.

447
00:38:00,729 --> 00:38:03,595
Oh, bringing 15 puppies into the world,
I guess she's got a right.

448
00:38:03,666 --> 00:38:06,793
Yeah. But they're
so beautiful.

449
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:09,894
You can
go in now, Pongo.

450
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:16,108
Here we are, Perdy.
Yes, it's Lucky.

451
00:38:16,179 --> 00:38:18,805
Now make room, you others.

452
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:23,010
Well done, Perdy.
There's a good girl.

453
00:38:25,088 --> 00:38:28,317
I'll leave you two alone.

454
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:44,001
I'm glad I'm only
having the one.

455
00:39:03,058 --> 00:39:05,651
Anita?

456
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:07,888
Anita?
There you are!

457
00:39:07,964 --> 00:39:11,728
Where are the puppies?
They should have arrived by now.

458
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:17,204
How marvelous.

459
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:19,569
How marvelous!

460
00:39:20,642 --> 00:39:22,575
How perfect...

461
00:39:22,645 --> 00:39:26,512
Oh, the devil take it! They're mongrels!

462
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:29,345
No spots!
No spots at all!

463
00:39:29,418 --> 00:39:32,079
What horrible little white rats!

464
00:39:32,155 --> 00:39:34,747
Oh, but their spots
don't come 'til later.

465
00:39:34,824 --> 00:39:37,257
- You're sure?
- Yes.

466
00:39:37,325 --> 00:39:41,762
All right, put them in a bag.
I'll take them with me now.

467
00:39:41,831 --> 00:39:45,060
- What? They were just born!
- I can see that!

468
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:47,897
But, Cruella, the puppies have to be
with their mother for several weeks.

469
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,801
- They're not ready to leave. - Fine, put
the little brutes on reserve for me.

470
00:39:50,873 --> 00:39:53,500
- How much would you like?
- They're not for sale.

471
00:39:53,576 --> 00:39:57,408
Oh'? You've come into

I want the job done tonight.
Can you do it?

Any way you want.
Poison them. Drown them.

Bash them on the head!
Got any chloroform?

If you ask me, they will. I think
they just went looking for the puppies.

You know who did this,

Dogs have a sixth sense

She did steal the puppies,
and this is why.

She's going to
kill the puppies.

01:28:39,834 --> 01:28:42,096
- Very kind.
- Thank you.

792
01:28:42,169 --> 01:28:44,898
Nice and quiet.

793
01:28:47,808 --> 01:28:50,571
- This is lovely. Yeah.
- Isn't it?

794
01:28:50,644 --> 01:28:53,135
Nice and warm.

795
01:28:53,213 --> 01:28:55,545
No animals neither.

796
01:29:19,906 --> 01:29:22,932
You... beasts!

797
01:29:23,011 --> 01:29:26,740
But I'm not beaten yet.

798
01:29:26,814 --> 01:29:30,248
You've won the battle,
but I'm about to win the wardrobe.

799
01:29:30,317 --> 01:29:33,911
My spotty puppy coat is
in plain sight and leaving tracks.

800
01:29:33,988 --> 01:29:36,376
In a moment I'll have
what I came for, while

801
01:29:36,389 --> 01:29:38,788
all of you will end
up as sausage meat...

802
01:29:38,860 --> 01:29:41,793
Alone on some sad plastic plate...

803
01:29:41,863 --> 01:29:45,957
Dead and medium red;
no friends, no family, no pulse...

804
01:29:46,034 --> 01:29:49,593
Just slapped between two buns,
smothered in onions...

805
01:29:49,669 --> 01:29:51,830
With fries on the side.

Oh'? Ls there
something wrong?

810
01:31:01,508 --> 01:31:04,499
Stop. What's that up ahead?

811
01:31:13,720 --> 01:31:16,518
Well, will you look at that.

812
01:31:48,221 --> 01:31:51,315
Excuse me, madame.
Would you mind standing back?

813
01:31:55,763 --> 01:31:59,357
I've come up with 98 pups.
The two adults make it 100 even.

814
01:31:59,432 --> 01:32:01,491
We've got 100 here, sir.

815
01:32:17,984 --> 01:32:20,213
Make that...

816
01:32:20,287 --> 01:32:24,154
101 dalmatians, sir.

817
01:32:41,741 --> 01:32:42,741
Congratulations.

818
01:32:42,742 --> 01:32:44,232
Congratulations.

819
01:32:44,312 --> 01:32:47,211
You've just won
gold, silver and bronze...

820
01:32:47,281 --> 01:32:49,873
In the Morons Olympics.

821
01:32:58,425 --> 01:33:00,620
- Who won the gold?
- Shut up!

822
01:33:02,596 --> 01:33:05,894
My business,
my reputation, my life...

823
01:33:05,966 --> 01:33:09,128
Has been ruined
because you three incompetent twits...

824
01:33:09,202 --> 01:33:12,330
Let yourselves be outsmarted
by a bunch of dumb animals!

825
01:33:12,406 --> 01:33:15,431
And you call
yourselves men. Ha!

826
01:33:15,508 --> 01:33:18,966
I've seen more intelligent

Oh! That a boy!
That a boy! Yeah!

833

- Oh! Oh!

01:34:09,397 --> 01:34:13,889
Oh, thank you, Officer!
How can we ever repay you?

835
01:34:13,968 --> 01:34:18,335
Well, your dogs were the only ones
with identification tags.

836
01:34:18,406 --> 01:34:21,134
We have no idea
which puppy goes where.

837
01:34:21,208 --> 01:34:24,335
Our records indicate
that so far...

838
01:34:24,411 --> 01:34:27,903
Nobody has called
to claim the other puppies.

839
01:34:27,982 --> 01:34:30,574
Now, they need a home, or...

840
01:34:30,651 --> 01:34:33,812
Well, they go to the pound.

841
01:34:41,361 --> 01:34:44,125
Oh, no. No.
No, no, no, no.

842
01:34:44,198 --> 01:34:47,996
- Roger, we can't... We don't have room.
- Well, we'll get a bigger place.

843
01:34:48,068 --> 01:34:51,503
We have 17 as it is.
What's a few more?

844
01:34:51,572 --> 01:34:53,903
We'll work something out.
